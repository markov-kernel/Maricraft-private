# Minecraft Creator Parity Reference (Java vs Bedrock) — **1.20+** (Creators/Tech Focus)

**Scope:** This is a creator-facing, technical “differences doc” covering **packs, commands, functions, scripting, state, item/behavior systems, and version-to-version breakpoints** from **Java 1.20 → 1.21.10** and **Bedrock 1.20 → 1.21.124** (latest as of **Dec 6, 2025**). ([Minecraft.net][1])
It intentionally focuses on **syntax + runtime behavior differences** that matter when building/porting content.

---

## 0) One-sentence mental model (the “why everything differs”)

* **Java**: “Everything is *inspectable* and *mutable* via commands/NBT (and now typed item components).”
* **Bedrock**: “Everything is *declared* up-front in JSON components; runtime state is *properties + events*, with the **Script API** as the real escape hatch.”

Java’s huge shift in this era is the **1.20.5 item data format change** (NBT `tag` → validated **Item Stack Components**, with `minecraft:custom_data` as the custom-data “escape hatch”). ([Minecraft.net][2])
Bedrock’s corresponding model is **Entity Properties** (declared, typed, optionally client-synced) + **Dynamic Properties** (script-managed persistent key/value) + **Custom Components**. ([Microsoft Learn][3])

---

## 1) Engine / world storage / simulation philosophy (creator-relevant implications)

### 1.1 Execution + determinism (especially for “command contraptions”)

* **Java** command/function execution is fundamentally **single-tick, linear, deterministic** in a way creators exploit for reliable sequencing; chained function calls execute in the same tick as their parent. ([Minecraft Wiki][4])
* **Bedrock** has command/function execution, *plus* an event-driven Script API; Bedrock simulation behavior is often less deterministic in creator practice (notably redstone), so “timing tricks” are less portable (see redstone section).

### 1.2 Redstone is not a “parity target”

* **Java**: quasi-connectivity, deterministic-ish update patterns enable many compact designs (e.g., QC piston powering).
* **Bedrock**: no QC; different piston timing/behavior; update order differences make some circuits unreliable to port. (Mojang explicitly documents cross-edition differences.)

---

## 2) Pack systems & file layouts (and the 1.21+ minefield)

## 2.1 Java: Data Packs (logic + data) and Resource Packs (assets)

### 2.1.1 Major breaking change: directory names went singular in the 1.21 cycle

During the 1.21 snapshot cycle, many directories were renamed **plural → singular** (e.g., `functions/` → `function/`, `loot_tables/` → `loot_table/`, etc.), breaking older pack layouts. ([Minecraft.net][5])

### 2.1.2 Pack versions changed repeatedly (1.20.5 → 1.21.9)

Key anchor points (useful when maintaining multi-version builds):

| Java release | Key creator-facing “pack” breakpoints                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1.20.5**   | Item stack data format replaced NBT `tag` with **components**; data pack version became **41**. ([Minecraft.net][2])                                                             |
| **1.21**     | Data pack version **48**, resource pack version **34**; new data-driven registries (paintings, jukebox songs, enchantments, etc.) in the 42–48 range notes. ([Minecraft.net][6]) |
| **1.21.5**   | **GameTests via data packs** introduced; data pack versions **62–71**. ([Minecraft.net][7])                                                                                      |
| **1.21.6**   | Data pack version **80**, resource pack version **63**; **all JSON parsed in strict mode**. ([Minecraft.net][8])                                                                 |
| **1.21.9**   | Pack versions can have **minor versions** (e.g., 88.0); `pack.mcmeta` metadata rules changed (see below). ([Minecraft.net][9])                                                   |

### 2.1.3 `pack.mcmeta` evolution: overlays → min/max format

* **1.20.2+** introduced features like **format ranges** and **pack overlays** to ship one pack that supports multiple formats. ([Minecraft Feedback][10])
* **1.21.9** changed metadata rules: `supported_formats` removed; `pack_format` no longer required; **`min_format` required**, and the old supported-range information now maps into **`max_format`**. ([Minecraft.net][9])

**Practical implication:** if you distribute packs meant to span multiple minor versions, your build system should:

* emit the correct `pack.mcmeta` schema per target era, and/or
* use overlays/ranges where supported.

## 2.2 Bedrock: Add-Ons = Behavior Pack + Resource Pack (+ Script)

Bedrock content is manifest-driven:

* `manifest.json` is required and declares **UUIDs**, **modules**, **dependencies**, and **min_engine_version** gating. ([Microsoft Learn][11])
* **`min_engine_version` is a feature gate**: e.g., Bedrock’s new `/execute` syntax requires opting in via version in manifest for packs. ([Microsoft Learn][12])

Typical Behavior Pack top-level folders:

* `entities/`, `items/`, `blocks/`, `loot_tables/`, `recipes/`, `functions/`, `scripts/`, `spawn_rules/`, `features/`, etc. (Exact folders vary by feature set.)

---

## 3) Data model & state management

## 3.1 Java (1.20.5+): hybrid world — NBT still exists, but *items* moved

### Entities/Block Entities

* Still largely NBT-backed and command-addressable (“classic Java behavior”).

### Items (1.20.5+)

* Item stacks use **validated, typed components** replacing the old freeform `tag`. ([Minecraft.net][2])
* Custom freeform data is still allowed via **`minecraft:custom_data`**. ([Minecraft.net][2])

## 3.2 Bedrock: declared components + properties + scripts

Bedrock does **not** provide general “NBT introspection” via commands. Instead you use:

### A) Entity Properties (declared, typed, optionally client-synced)

* Declared on the entity definition, typed (bool/int/float/enum), persisted, and can be `"client_sync": true` to expose to client-side Molang/animation usage. ([Microsoft Learn][3])

### B) Dynamic Properties (script-managed persistent key/value)

* Persistent across restarts, meant for “arbitrary” creator state (closest conceptual match to Java’s storage/NBT tricks—but via Script API).

### C) Custom Components (block/item/entity hooks)

* Lets you bind script behavior directly to content via registered components.

---

## 4) Commands: “syntax parity” vs “capability parity”

## 4.1 `/execute`: Bedrock adopted Java-like syntax, but *not* Java power

Bedrock’s new execute syntax (1.19.70+) moved toward Java style (`as`, `positioned`, `if`, etc.), and the docs explicitly warn it is **not** full parity—especially **no storing results**.

### 4.1.1 Capability matrix (creator-meaningful highlights)

| Capability                         | Java | Bedrock | Why it matters                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---: | ------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chainable `as/at/positioned` style |    ✅ |       ✅ | Basic parity.                                                                         |
| Multiple `if/unless` conditions    |    ✅ |       ✅ | Bedrock supports multiple `if/unless` forms.                                          |
| `if/unless score`                  |    ✅ |       ✅ | Strong porting target.                                                                |
| `if/unless block(s)`               |    ✅ |       ✅ | Strong porting target.                                                                |
| `if/unless data` (NBT check)       |    ✅ |       ❌ | Bedrock has no general NBT data condition; must use properties/scripts.               |
| `if/unless predicate`              |    ✅ |       ❌ | Java predicates are reusable JSON logic; Bedrock uses filters/Molang/scripts instead. |
| `store result/success`             |    ✅ |       ❌ | This is the biggest “command-only design” blocker for Bedrock.                        |

## 4.2 Java-only: `/data` introspection & mutation

Java’s `/data` enables direct get/merge/modify/remove on entity and block-entity NBT and on persistent command storage.
Bedrock has no direct equivalent; porting usually means **Entity Properties + Dynamic Properties + Script API**.

## 4.3 `/schedule`: the divergence shrank — Bedrock now has time delays too

* **Java** `/schedule` delays execution of a function after a time amount.
* **Bedrock** historically emphasized “run on area loaded” (still present), but current Bedrock also supports **delay scheduling** (ticks/seconds/days) via `/schedule delay add …`.

**Porting note:** if your Java pack uses `/schedule` heavily, Bedrock’s `/schedule delay` plus Script API scheduling (`system.run*`) can replace many patterns.

---

## 5) Items: syntax, mutation, and “you can’t just /give it” reality

## 5.1 Java: `/give` item component syntax (1.20.5+)

Because item stacks are component-based now, item commands and saved item formats changed. Java’s release notes spell out:

* `tag` replaced by components
* custom data supported via `minecraft:custom_data`
* command item syntax updated to support components.

**Example pattern (Java 1.20.5+):**

```mcfunction
give @s diamond_sword[
  damage=10,
  custom_name='{"text":"Excalibur"}',
  enchantments={sharpness:5},
  custom_data={MyTag:1b}
]
```

(Names and available components are version-dependent, but the component concept + `custom_data` are the key. )

## 5.2 Bedrock: `/give` component/NBT is extremely limited

Bedrock does not let you arbitrarily inject full item definitions or arbitrary “NBT-like” structures the way Java historically did. A common creator-facing summary:

* Bedrock `/give` supports only a limited set of NBT-like components (e.g., `can_place_on`, `can_destroy`, `keep_on_death`, `item_lock`) rather than open-ended per-item structures.

**Therefore the Bedrock-first pattern is:**

1. define the custom item in the Behavior Pack (components, events, component groups), then
2. `/give` the custom identifier, and/or mutate via Script API.

**Bedrock custom item definition concept:**

---

## 6) Logic engines: Java functions/macros vs Bedrock functions/scripts

## 6.1 Java `.mcfunction` execution model

* Functions run all commands in a single tick; nested calls also run in the same tick.
* Large command chains are guarded by `maxCommandChainLength` (default **65,536**).

### 6.1.1 Macros (1.20.2+) and the “template function” era

Java 1.20.2 introduced macro functions (parameterized function text expansion), enabling “variable-like” placeholders in `.mcfunction` content.

## 6.2 Bedrock: MCFunctions + Script API (JavaScript/TypeScript)

Bedrock has `.mcfunction` + `tick.json` scheduling, but complex logic increasingly belongs in scripts.

### 6.2.1 Bedrock function scheduling (`tick.json`) and limits

Bedrock behavior packs can run functions automatically via `tick.json`.
(Also: Bedrock has `functioncommandlimit` and other performance guardrails, but the exact defaults can vary by platform/server config; favor testing and explicit limits.)

### 6.2.2 Script scheduling: `system.run*` replaces “setTimeout”

Bedrock’s script runtime doesn’t provide JS `setTimeout`; it provides tick-based scheduling with `system.run*` APIs and dedicated guidance.

### 6.2.3 Custom slash commands (Script API)

Bedrock scripts can register custom commands with typed parameters.

---

## 7) Conditional logic: Java predicates vs Bedrock filters/Molang

## 7.1 Java JSON Predicates

Java supports reusable predicate JSON and `execute if predicate …` (powerful when paired with NBT + store + score workflows). (Predicate specifics depend on version; your packs will need version-scoped JSON.)

## 7.2 Bedrock filters + Molang + properties

Bedrock’s JSON systems (entities, events, spawn rules, etc.) use filter objects and Molang expressions; plus script checks. Entity Properties are explicitly designed to be queryable from client logic when synced.

**Porting rule of thumb:**

* Java predicate → Bedrock filter/Molang for declarative cases
* Java predicate + `/execute store` workflows → Bedrock Script API checks + Dynamic Properties

---

## 8) Data-driven registries & “what you can add without mods”

## 8.1 Java 1.21: several systems became data-driven in packs

Java 1.21’s technical notes explicitly call out new data-driven systems (within “Data Pack Versions 42–48”), including:

* **Painting variants data-driven** (with defined JSON path)
* **Jukebox songs data-driven** (with defined JSON path)
* **Enchantments data-driven** (and providers/tags controlling availability/exclusivity)

**Implication:** Java data packs gained *more* “registry-level” customization in 1.21+ than Bedrock’s equivalent workflow (which often needs resource pack assets + scripts + defined components).

## 8.2 Bedrock: you can define new entities/blocks/items—but within schemas

Bedrock add-ons can define custom entities/blocks/items as first-class content via JSON component systems, but you must work inside defined schemas and use scripts for “dynamic” behavior.

---

## 9) Version-by-version creator breakpoints (1.20+)

### 9.1 Java Edition (selected “creator-impact” milestones)

* **1.20.2**: macro functions; pack overlay/range tooling in pack metadata.
* **1.20.5**: item stack data format → components; custom data via `minecraft:custom_data`; command syntax updated accordingly. ([Minecraft.net][13])
* **1.21**: data pack version 48; directory name modernization + more systems data-driven (paintings/songs/enchantments). ([Minecraft.net][5])
* **1.21.5**: GameTests in data packs. ([Minecraft.net][7])
* **1.21.6**: strict JSON parsing; new `/datapack create`, `/version`.
* **1.21.9**: pack metadata schema changes (`min_format`/`max_format`) and pack minor versions. ([Minecraft.net][9])
* **1.21.10**: hotfix on top of 1.21.9.

### 9.2 Bedrock Edition (selected “creator-impact” milestones)

* **1.19.70+**: new `/execute` syntax available; requires `min_engine_version` to opt-in for packs; and explicitly lacks store-result parity.
* **1.21.20**: migration pressure toward stable Custom Components (notably after removal of older experimental toggles). ([Minecraft.net][14])
* **1.21.120**: official Bedrock changelog series continues; creators should track Microsoft Learn “update notes for creators.” ([Microsoft Learn][15])
* **1.21.124**: latest hotfix as of Nov 21 2025.

---

## 10) Porting playbooks (common “Java pack” patterns → Bedrock equivalents)

### 10.1 “Store per-entity state”

**Java options**

* scoreboard for numbers
* tags for booleans
* NBT on entity (and `/data`) for structured state
* item `custom_data` for item state (1.20.5+)

**Bedrock options**

* **Entity Properties** for declared state (fast, type-safe, optionally client-sync)
* **Dynamic Properties** for arbitrary/persistent script-managed state

### 10.2 “Give a custom item with mutable runtime traits”

* **Java**: `/give` with components; mutate via loot/item modifiers (`/item modify`) + functions.
* **Bedrock**: define item in BP JSON; mutate via scripts (inventory ItemStack edits) + component groups/events.

### 10.3 “Delay logic”

* **Java**: `/schedule function …` + tags (`#minecraft:tick`) is standard.
* **Bedrock**: `/schedule delay add …` and/or Script API `system.run*`.

---

## 11) Testing & CI (professional creator workflow)

### 11.1 Java: GameTest in data packs (1.21.5+)

Java now supports GameTests through data packs. ([Minecraft.net][7])

### 11.2 Bedrock: mature GameTest + Script tooling

Bedrock’s creator ecosystem strongly supports script-driven testing and tooling; Microsoft Learn provides scripting guides and APIs for building robust loops and timed callbacks.

# Appendix A — Quick “parity truth table” (what not to assume)

| You might assume…                                      | Reality                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “Same command name ⇒ same capability.”                 | Bedrock `/execute` looks similar but lacks `store` and NBT conditions; Java command-only designs often need scripts on Bedrock.            |
| “I can just /give a fully customized item everywhere.” | Java (1.20.5+) supports rich item components; Bedrock `/give` customization is limited and typically requires BP-defined items or scripts. |
| “Schedule works the same.”                             | Bedrock now supports both time-delay and on-area-loaded scheduling, but syntax and prior assumptions differ.                               |
| “Pack metadata stays stable.”                          | Java pack metadata changed materially in 1.21.9; JSON strictness in 1.21.6; folder naming broke in 1.21. ([Minecraft.net][9])              |

---

If you want, I can also output this as a **clean “spec-style” doc** (with: a strict glossary of terms, a complete `/execute` subcommand cross-map, and side-by-side templates for `pack.mcmeta` + `manifest.json`)—but the above is the merged, unified “full reference” version.
