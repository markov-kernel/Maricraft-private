# Custom Components

Components are third-party Python modules that extend what's possible with Streamlit.

## How to use a Component

Components are super easy to use:

1. Start by finding the Component you'd like to use. Two great resources for this are:
   - The [Component gallery](https://streamlit.io/components)
   - [This thread](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/streamlit-components-community-tracker/4634),
     by Fanilo A. from our forums.
2. Install the Component using your favorite Python package manager. This step and all following
steps are described in your component's instructions.

For example, to use the fantastic [AgGrid\\
Component](https://github.com/PablocFonseca/streamlit-aggrid), you first install it with:

`pip install streamlit-aggrid
`

3. In your Python code, import the Component as described in its instructions. For AgGrid, this step
is:

`from st_aggrid import AgGrid
`

4. ...now you're ready to use it! For AgGrid, that's:

`AgGrid(my_dataframe)
`

## Making your own Component
