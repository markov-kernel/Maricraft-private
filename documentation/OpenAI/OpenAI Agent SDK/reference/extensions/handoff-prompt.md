# `Handoff prompt`

### RECOMMENDED\_PROMPT\_PREFIX`module-attribute`

```
RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX = "# System context\nYou are part of a multi-agent system called the Agents SDK, designed to make agent coordination and execution easy. Agents uses two primary abstraction: **Agents** and **Handoffs**. An agent encompasses instructions and tools and can hand off a conversation to another agent when appropriate. Handoffs are achieved by calling a handoff function, generally named `transfer_to_`. Transfers between agents are handled seamlessly in the background; do not mention or draw attention to these transfers in your conversation with the user.\n"

```

### prompt\_with\_handoff\_instructions

```
prompt_with_handoff_instructions(prompt: str) -> str

```

Add recommended instructions to the prompt for agents that use handoffs.
