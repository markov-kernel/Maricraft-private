# `Streaming events`

### StreamEvent`module-attribute`

```
StreamEvent: TypeAlias = Union[\
    RawResponsesStreamEvent,\
    RunItemStreamEvent,\
    AgentUpdatedStreamEvent,\
]

```

A streaming event from an agent.

### RawResponsesStreamEvent`dataclass`

Streaming event from the LLM. These are 'raw' events, i.e. they are directly passed through
from the LLM.

Source code in `src/agents/stream_events.py`

These are 'raw' events, i.e. they are directly passed through    from the LLM.    """    data: TResponseStreamEvent    """The raw responses streaming event from the LLM."""    type: Literal["raw_response_event"] = "raw_response_event"    """The type of the event."""``` |

#### data`instance-attribute`

```
data: TResponseStreamEvent

```

The raw responses streaming event from the LLM.

#### type`class-attribute``instance-attribute`

```
type: Literal['raw_response_event'] = 'raw_response_event'

```

The type of the event.

### RunItemStreamEvent`dataclass`

Streaming events that wrap a `RunItem`. As the agent processes the LLM response, it will
generate these events for new messages, tool calls, tool outputs, handoffs, etc.

    "mcp_list_tools",\
]

```

The name of the event.

#### item`instance-attribute`

```
item: RunItem
