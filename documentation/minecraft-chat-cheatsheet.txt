Minecraft Java 1.20.1 Chat Command Cheat Sheet


Chat & Permissions

- Prefix: Commands must start with /. 
- Length: Max 256 characters per chat command.
- Cheats: Enable Allow Cheats in a singleplayer world or be an operator (OP) on a server.
- Multi-line: Not supported — one line only. 
- Command blocks: Accept much longer commands (≈32,767 chars) and do not need the / prefix.


Syntax & Structure

- Brigadier parser: literal <required_argument> [optional_argument] (choice_one|choice_two) …
- Quoted strings: Use 'single' or "double" quotes to contain arguments with spaces.
- Escaping quotes: Inside a 'single'-quoted string use \' for apostrophes; inside a "double"-quoted string use \".


Target Selectors

- @p → nearest player, @a → all players, @r → random player, @s → self, @e → all entities.
- Filters go in [] and are comma-separated.
  - Example: @e[type=zombie,distance=..5,limit=1,sort=nearest]


Coordinates

- Absolute: 100 64 -30 — fixed world coords (X Y Z).
- Relative: ~ ~ ~ — relative to executor position. Offsets like ~5 ~ ~-3 are allowed.
- Local: ^ ^ ^ — relative to look direction: ^left/right ^up/down ^forward/backward.
  - IMPORTANT: Each caret coordinate must have a numeric value. A bare ^ is invalid. Use ^0 for zero offset.
    - Valid: ^-18 ^0 ^22
    - Invalid: ^-18 ^ ^22  (bare ^ → “Expected double” error)
- Do not mix coordinate types within the same coordinate triplet. All three numbers in a set must be of the same type (all absolute, all ~, or all ^).


Block States

- Syntax: minecraft:block_id[property1=value1,property2=value2]
- Properties are specific to each block.
  - Example: Standing sign (oak_sign) uses rotation, wall sign (oak_wall_sign) uses facing.
    - setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:oak_sign[rotation=8]
    - setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:oak_wall_sign[facing=south]


NBT (SNBT format)

- Compound: {key:value, ...}   List: [item1, item2, ...]
- Numeric suffixes: 10b (byte), 5s (short), 3L (long), 1.5f (float), 2.0d (double). Integers can omit suffix.
- Strings: Must be in 'single' or "double" quotes.
- Namespaces: Always include minecraft: prefix for clarity (e.g., minecraft:stone, minecraft:sharpness).


Raw JSON Text

- Used in names, lore, signs, tellraw, title, etc. When embedded in SNBT it must be a single string.
  - Example Name (SNBT with double-quoted JSON): display:{Name:"{\"text\":\"Cursed Blade\",\"italic\":false}"}
  - Example Name (SNBT with single-quoted JSON; escape ASCII apostrophes inside JSON):
    display:{Name:'{"text":"Marin\'s Blade","italic":false}'}
  - Tip: Using typographic apostrophe (’ U+2019) inside JSON also avoids closing a single-quoted SNBT string.


Resource Locations

- Format: namespace:id — default namespace is minecraft.
- Examples: minecraft:netherite_sword, minecraft:sharpness, minecraft:zombie


Pre-flight Checklist (Before Enter)

1) Under 256 chars (or using a command block)?
2) Cheats enabled / OP permissions?
3) All {} and [] balanced (no missing commas between entries)?
4) Raw JSON (names/signs) is a single, well-formed string and any ' inside single-quoted JSON is escaped (\')?
5) Target selector filters @e[...] are comma-separated?
6) Coordinate sets do not mix types (no ~ with ^ in the same set)?
7) Caret coordinates have explicit numbers (replace any bare ^ with ^0)?
8) Block states used are valid for that block (facing vs rotation, etc.)?
